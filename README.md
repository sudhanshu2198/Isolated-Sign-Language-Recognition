Deaf Children are characterized by a lack of access to naturally occurring language acquisition during their critical language-learning years. It can cause serious impacts on different aspects of their lives, such as relationships, education, and employment. In order to communicate they utilize sign language which are extremely difficult for hearning people to understand, severly constraining their access to the different services.

A solution to the problem could be system that correctly classifies sign meaning and join them to create words and sentences, enabling them to effectively communicate with other persons.

# Dataset
- American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language. The brain processes linguistic information through the eyes.
- The shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements, all play important parts in conveying information.
- Sign language is not a universal language â€” each country has its own sign language, and regions have dialects, much like the many languages spoken all over the world.

**The main goal of this project is to develop image classificarion system with vgg architecture that correctly classifies sign language characters.**
